Perform a Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test for a Proportion

This function performs a two-tailed hypothesis test for a proportion to determine
if the sample proportion significantly differs from the null hypothesis proportion.
The default null hypothesis proportion is set to 0.5.

The calculation involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the sample proportion (p_hat):
p_hat = successes / trials
\item Set the null hypothesis proportion (p_0):
p_0 = 0.5
\item Calculate the standard error (SE) for the null hypothesis proportion using:
SE = sqrt((p_0 * (1 - p_0)) / trials)
\item Compute the z-test statistic:
z = (p_hat - p_0) / SE
\item Calculate the p-value for the two-tailed test:
p-value = 2 * (1 - P(Z <= |z|)) = 2 * (1 - pnorm(|z|))
\item Determine the critical z-value for the specified significance level:
z_critical = qnorm(1 - (alpha / 2))
\item Make a decision based on the comparison of the absolute z-test statistic with the critical z-value:
\itemize{
\item If |z| > z_critical, reject the null hypothesis.
\item Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
}
}

This function checks assumptions, calculates the test statistic, p-value, and provides a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis test on the population proportion.
