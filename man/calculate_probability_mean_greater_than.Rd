\title{Calculate Probability of Sample Mean Greater Than or Equal to Target}
\usage{
calculate_probability_mean_greater_than(
  population_mean,
  population_sd,
  sample_size,
  sample_mean
)
}
\arguments{
\item{population_mean}{The mean of the population (numeric).}

\item{population_sd}{The standard deviation of the population (numeric).}

\item{sample_size}{The size of the sample (integer).}

\item{sample_mean}{The target sample mean (numeric).}
}
\value{
The probability as a numeric value representing the likelihood of the sample mean
being greater than or equal to the target.
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability of the sample mean being greater than or equal
to a specified target value based on the population mean, population standard deviation,
and sample size. This is useful for hypothesis testing and assessing how likely it is
to observe a sample mean at or above a certain threshold under the null hypothesis.
}
\details{
The calculation involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean using the formula:
SE = sigma / sqrt(n)
where sigma is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.
\item Compute the z-score for the target sample mean using the formula:
z = (x_bar - mu) / SE
where x_bar is the target sample mean and mu is the population mean.
\item Calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean greater than or equal to the target
value using the complementary cumulative distribution function:
P(X >= x_bar) = 1 - P(Z <= z) = 1 - pnorm(z)
}
