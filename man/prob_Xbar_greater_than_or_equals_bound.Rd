\title{Find P(Xbar >equals bound)}
\usage{
prob_Xbar_greater_than_or_equals_bound(
  bound,
  population_mean,
  population_variance,
  sample_size
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bound}{The value of the bound for Xbar (numeric).}

\item{population_mean}{The population mean (numeric).}

\item{population_variance}{The population variance (numeric).}

\item{sample_size}{The sample size (numeric).}
}
\value{
The probability P(Xbar >equals bound).
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability that the sample mean Xbar is greater than or equal to a specified bound,
assuming the sample mean follows a normal distribution.
