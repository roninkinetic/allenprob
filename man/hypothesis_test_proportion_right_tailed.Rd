\title{Hypothesis Test for Population Proportion (Right-Tailed)}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_proportion_right_tailed(n, x, p0, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size, the number of cases (e.g., voters).}

\item{x}{The number of cases with the outcome of interest (e.g., voters supporting a candidate).}

\item{p0}{The hypothesized population proportion (e.g., 0.50 for 50\%).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the sampling distribution, assumptions check, hypotheses, test statistic, p-value, rejection region, decision, and conclusion.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test to determine if the population proportion is greater than a specified value.
}
\details{
This function checks assumptions, calculates the test statistic, and provides a one-tailed hypothesis test on the population proportion.
