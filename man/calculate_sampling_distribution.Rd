\title{Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution}
\usage{
calculate_sampling_distribution(p, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The population proportion (numeric, should be between 0 and 1).}

\item{n}{The sample size (integer, must be greater than 0).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: The mean of the sampling distribution (numeric).
\item \code{standard_deviation}: The standard deviation (standard error) of the sampling distribution (numeric).
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean and standard deviation (standard error) of the
sampling distribution for a given population proportion and sample size.
The mean of the sampling distribution for proportions is equal to the population
proportion, and the standard deviation (standard error) is derived from the formula
for the standard deviation of a proportion.
}
\details{
The calculations are performed as follows:
\enumerate{
\item The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population proportion:
mean = p
\item The standard deviation (standard error) of the sampling distribution is calculated using the formula:
standard deviation = sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
}
}
