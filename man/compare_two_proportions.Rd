\title{Compare Two Proportions}
\usage{
compare_two_proportions(p1, n1, p2, n2, confidence_level = 0.95, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{The proportion of freshmen who oppose the plan.}

\item{n1}{The sample size of freshmen.}

\item{p2}{The proportion of seniors who oppose the plan.}

\item{n2}{The sample size of seniors.}

\item{confidence_level}{The confidence level for the confidence interval (e.g., 0.95 for 95\% confidence).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (e.g., 0.05 for a 5\% significance level).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{test_statistic}: The z-test statistic for comparing the two proportions.
\item \code{p_value}: The p-value of the hypothesis test.
\item \code{reject_H0}: A message indicating whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\item \code{confidence_interval}: The confidence interval for the difference in proportions.
\item \code{explanation}: A simple explanation of the result.
}
}
\description{
This function performs a hypothesis test and calculates a confidence interval for the difference between
two population proportions (e.g., proportion of freshmen and seniors opposing a plan). It also determines
whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and provides a simple explanation of the result.

\examples{
result <- compare_two_proportions(160/200, 200, 20/100, 100, 0.95, 0.05)
