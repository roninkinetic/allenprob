\title{Perform a Hypothesis Test for a Fair Coin Flip}
\usage{
coin_hypothesis_test(heads, total_flips, alpha = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{heads}{An integer representing the number of heads observed in the coin flips (integer).}

\item{total_flips}{An integer representing the total number of coin flips (integer).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value representing the significance level (default is 0.01).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{z_value}: The calculated z statistic (numeric).
\item \code{critical_value}: The critical z value for the two-tailed test (numeric).
\item \code{decision}: A string indicating whether to "Reject H0" or "Fail to Reject H0".
}
}
\description{
This function tests the claim that a coin is fair (p = 0.5) against the alternative
that it is not fair (p <> 0.5) using a two-tailed hypothesis test. The function
calculates the z statistic for the observed number of heads in a series of coin flips,
and compares it against the critical value derived from the specified significance level.
}
\details{
The null hypothesis (H0) states that the coin is fair, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) states that
the coin is not fair.

\examples{
coin_test_result <- coin_hypothesis_test(heads = 56, total_flips = 100)
print(coin_test_result)
