\title{Calculate Probability of Cost Being Less Than a Given Value}
\usage{
calculate_probability_cost_less_than(mean_cost, sd_cost, threshold_cost)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean_cost}{The mean cost of the distribution (numeric).}

\item{sd_cost}{The standard deviation of the cost (numeric).}

\item{threshold_cost}{The cost threshold to compare against (numeric).}
}
\value{
The probability of the cost being less than the threshold (numeric).
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability that a cost is less than a specified threshold,
based on the mean and standard deviation of the cost distribution. This is useful for
understanding the likelihood of costs falling below a certain level in a normally
distributed context.
}
\details{
The calculation involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the z-score corresponding to the threshold cost using the formula:
z = (X - mu) / sigma
where X is the threshold cost, mu is the mean cost, and sigma is the standard deviation of the cost.
\item Use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution
to find the probability that a cost is less than the threshold:
P(X < threshold_cost) = P(Z <= z) = pnorm(z)
}
