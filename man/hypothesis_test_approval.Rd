\title{Hypothesis Test for Candidate Approval Rating}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_approval(n, x, p0 = 0.5, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size, the number of voters surveyed.}

\item{x}{The number of voters who said they might vote for Candidate A.}

\item{p0}{The hypothesized population proportion (0.50 in this case).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the detailed steps, including the assumptions, critical z-value, test statistic,
p-value, decision, and conclusion, with all work shown.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test to determine if Candidate A's approval rating is greater than 50\%.
}
\details{
This function calculates the test statistic and p-value for a one-sample proportion hypothesis test.
It checks the assumptions, sets up the null and alternative hypotheses, determines the rejection region,
and interprets the results based on the significance level.
