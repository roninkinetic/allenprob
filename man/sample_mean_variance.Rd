\title{sample_mean_variance: Calculate the mean and variance of a sample distribution}
\usage{
sample_mean_variance(X, P_X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector of values (numeric).}

\item{P_X}{A numeric vector of probabilities associated with X (numeric).
Length of P_X must be equal to length of X, and the probabilities should sum to 1.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: The mean of the sample distribution (numeric).
\item \code{variance}: The variance of the sample distribution (numeric).
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean and variance of a sample distribution given two vectors:
a vector of values (X) and a vector of probabilities (P(X)) associated with those values.
The function assumes that the probabilities are normalized (i.e., they sum to 1).
}
\details{
The calculations are performed as follows:
\enumerate{
\item The mean is calculated using the formula:
mean = sum(X * P(X))
\item The variance is calculated using the formula:
variance = sum((X - mean)^2 * P(X))
}
}
\examples{
sample_mean_variance(c(1, 2, 3), c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3))  # Example calculation
