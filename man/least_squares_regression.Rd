\title{least_squares_regression: Perform least squares regression using means, standard deviations, and correlation}
\usage{
least_squares_regression(ybar, xbar, s_x, s_y, R)
}
\arguments{
\item{ybar}{Mean of y values (numeric).}

\item{xbar}{Mean of x values (numeric).}

\item{s_x}{Standard deviation of x values (numeric).}

\item{s_y}{Standard deviation of y values (numeric).}

\item{R}{Correlation coefficient between x and y (numeric, should be between -1 and 1).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{slope}: The slope of the regression line (numeric).
\item \code{intercept}: The intercept of the regression line (numeric).
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the least squares regression line using the means of the dependent variable
(ybar) and the independent variable (xbar), the standard deviations of x (s_x) and y (s_y),
and the correlation coefficient (R) between the two variables.
}
\details{
The regression line is expressed in the form:
y = intercept + slope * x

The slope is calculated using the formula:
slope = R * (s_y / s_x)

The intercept is calculated as:
intercept = ybar - slope * xbar
