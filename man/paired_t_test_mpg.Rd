\title{Perform a Paired T-Test for MPG Differences}
\usage{
paired_t_test_mpg(computer, driver)
}
\arguments{
\item{computer}{A numeric vector representing the MPG values from the car's computer.}

\item{driver}{A numeric vector representing the MPG values calculated by the professor.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{t_statistic}: The calculated t statistic.
\item \code{p_value}: The p-value for the test.
\item \code{decision}: A string indicating whether to "Reject H0" or "Fail to reject H0".
}
}
\description{
This function conducts a paired t-test to test whether there is a significant difference
between the professor's calculated miles per gallon (MPG) and the car's computer estimate.
It performs a two-tailed hypothesis test for the mean difference.
}
\details{
The hypotheses are:
\itemize{
\item H0: The mean difference in MPG = 0 (no difference)
\item Ha: The mean difference in MPG <> 0 (there is a difference)
}
}

computer <- c(41.5, 45, 43.2, 43.2, 48.4, 46.8, 39.2, 43.5, 44.3, 43.3)
driver <- c(36.5, 40.5, 41, 38.8, 45.4, 45.7, 34.2, 39.8, 44.9, 47.5)
result <- paired_t_test_mpg(computer, driver)
