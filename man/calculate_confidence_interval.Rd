\title{Calculate Confidence Interval for Sample Mean}
\usage{
calculate_confidence_interval(
  sample_mean,
  sample_sd,
  sample_size,
  confidence_level
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_mean}{The mean of the sample (numeric).}

\item{sample_sd}{The standard deviation of the sample (numeric).}

\item{sample_size}{The size of the sample (integer).}

\item{confidence_level}{The confidence level (numeric, e.g., 0.95 for 95\% confidence).}
}
\value{
A list containing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower_bound}: The lower bound of the confidence interval.
\item \code{upper_bound}: The upper bound of the confidence interval.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the confidence interval for a sample mean based on the sample mean,
sample standard deviation, sample size, and desired confidence level. The confidence interval
provides a range of values within which the true population mean is expected to lie with a
specified level of confidence.
}
\details{
The calculation involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the significance level (alpha) from the confidence level:
alpha = 1 - confidence_level
\item Determine the critical z-value for the specified confidence level:
z = qnorm(1 - (alpha / 2)
This critical value corresponds to the desired level of confidence and accounts for the
tails of the normal distribution.
\item Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean using the formula:
SE = s / sqrt(n)
where s is the sample standard deviation and n is the sample size.
\item Calculate the margin of error using the formula:
ME = z * SE
\item The confidence interval is then given by:
CI = (sample_mean - ME, sample_mean + ME)
