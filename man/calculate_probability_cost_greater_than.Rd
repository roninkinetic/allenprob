\title{Calculate Probability of Cost Being Greater Than a Given Value}
\usage{
calculate_probability_cost_greater_than(mean_cost, sd_cost, threshold_cost)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean_cost}{The mean cost of the distribution (numeric).}

\item{sd_cost}{The standard deviation of the cost (numeric).}

\item{threshold_cost}{The cost threshold to compare against (numeric).}
}
\value{
The probability of the cost being greater than the threshold (numeric).
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability that a cost is greater than a specified threshold,
based on the mean and standard deviation of the cost distribution. This is useful for
understanding the likelihood of costs exceeding a certain level in a normally distributed
context.
}
\details{
The calculation involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the z-score corresponding to the threshold cost using the formula:
z = (X - mu) / sigma
where X is the threshold cost, mu is the mean cost, and sigma is the standard deviation of the cost.
\item Use the complementary cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution
to find the probability that a cost is greater than the threshold:
P(X > threshold_cost) = 1 - P(Z <= z) = 1 - pnorm(z)
}
