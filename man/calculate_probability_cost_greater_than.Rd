}
\arguments{
\item{mean_cost}{The mean cost of the distribution.}

\item{sd_cost}{The standard deviation of the cost.}

\item{threshold_cost}{The cost threshold to compare against.}
}
\value{
The probability of the cost being greater than the threshold.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability that a cost is greater than a specified threshold, based on the mean and standard deviation of the cost.
