\title{Hypothesis Test with Rejection Region for Average Radiation Level}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_with_rejection_region(
  n,
  sample_mean,
  mu = 420,
  sigma = 10,
  alpha = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size, the number of radiation level measurements.}

\item{sample_mean}{The sample mean of radiation levels.}

\item{mu}{The hypothesized population mean (default is 420).}

\item{sigma}{The population standard deviation of the radiation levels (default is 10).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.01).}
}
\value{
A list containing the test type, rejection region, test statistic, p-value, decision, and conclusion, with all work shown.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test to determine if the average radiation level in a laboratory differs from a specified mean (e.g., 420).
}
\details{
This function calculates the test statistic and p-value for a two-tailed hypothesis test on the average radiation level.
It provides step-by-step output including the rejection region, test statistic, and decision criteria.
