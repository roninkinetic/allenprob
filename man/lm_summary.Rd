\title{lm_summary: Perform linear regression and show the summary}
\usage{
lm_summary(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of independent variable values (numeric).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of dependent variable values (numeric).}
}
\value{
A summary of the linear model, which includes:
\itemize{
\item Coefficients: Estimates of the model parameters (intercept and slope).
\item Residuals: Summary statistics of the residuals.
\item Statistical significance: p-values for the coefficients.
\item R-squared value: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
}
}
\description{
This function takes two data vectors x and y and fits a linear model to them.
The linear model is of the form:
y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x + epsilon
where beta_0 is the intercept, beta_1 is the slope, and epsilon is the error term.
}
\examples{
lm_summary(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(2, 4, 6, 8))  # Linear relationship should yield a slope of 2
