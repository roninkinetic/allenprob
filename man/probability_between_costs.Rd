\title{Calculate Probability of Costs Between Two Values}
\usage{
probability_between_costs(lower_bound, upper_bound, mean, sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{lower_bound}{The lower bound of the cost range (numeric).}

\item{upper_bound}{The upper bound of the cost range (numeric).}

\item{mean}{The mean of the normal distribution (numeric).}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution (numeric).}
}
\value{
The probability that a cost falls between the lower and upper bounds (numeric).
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability that a cost, following a normal distribution, falls between two specified values.
}
\details{
The costs are assumed to follow a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.
