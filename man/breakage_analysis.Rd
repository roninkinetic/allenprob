  pdf_function,
  a = 0,
  b = 12,
  expected_break = 6,
  x1 = 4,

}
\arguments{
\item{pdf_function}{A function that calculates the PDF of Y.}

\item{a}{Lower bound for the probability calculations (default is 0).}

\item{b}{Upper bound for the probability calculations (default is 12, for the length of the bar).}

\item{expected_break}{The expected break point (default is the mean of the distribution).}

\item{x1}{First threshold for probability calculations (default is 4).}

\item{x2}{Second threshold for probability calculations (default is 6).}

\item{distance_from_expected}{The distance from the expected break point for probability calculation (default is 2).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{cdf} The cumulative distribution function.
\item \code{probabilities} A list of probabilities for specific ranges.
\item \code{expectations} A list containing the expected value, second moment, and variance.
\item \code{shorter_segment_expectation} The expected length of the shorter segment when the break occurs.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probabilities,
expectations, and variances for the distribution of the breakage point in a 12-inch bar.
The breakage point, denoted as Y, has a probability density function (PDF) defined by the user.
}
\details{
The function can compute the following:
\itemize{
\item The CDF of Y.
\item Specific probabilities such as P(Y <equalsto x1), P(Y > x2), and P(x1 <equalsto Y <equalsto x2).
\item The expected value E(Y), the second moment E(Y^2), and the variance Var(Y).
\item The probability that the break occurs more than a specified distance from the expected break point.
\item The expected length of the shorter segment when the break occurs.
}

# Define a simple PDF function for a uniform distribution over the range [0, 12]
